[NOTES]
  - No-op update: mod reference content expected under Canon/Mod References/1 provence start is missing (only .metadata present), so CA/LA and breakup/capacity logic cannot be validated or implemented.
[OPEN_ITEMS]
  - Provide the mod reference file(s) under Canon/Mod References/1 provence start (e.g., in_game/common or scripts) so the Authority Ledger update hook/breakup logic can be aligned with actual references.
