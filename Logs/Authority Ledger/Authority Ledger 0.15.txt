[NOTES]
  - Fixed authority base accumulation to write al_capital_base/al_local_base on the country scope so CA/LA/TA derive from non-zero totals.
  - Cleaned the redundant TA initialization block to a single guarded set_variable.
  - Moved LA location list additions to the country scope to avoid per-location list fragments.

  - None
