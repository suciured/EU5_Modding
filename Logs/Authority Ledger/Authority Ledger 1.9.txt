[NOTES]
  - Added a game-start setup effect that reassigns subject-owned locations to the top overlord, then runs a full authority update.
  - Routed subject capital locations into the overlord's Local Base (V3.8) while preserving subject Central Base (V3.7).
  - Documented the subject-capital routing override as a self patch.
[OPEN_ITEMS]
  - Define the full "release vassals to balance net authority toward zero" mechanism (effect names, sorting/priority rules, and subject creation/release patterns).
