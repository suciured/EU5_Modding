[TEMPLATE_CLEANUP]
  - Removed unused template folders/files:
    - Workspace/Mod/Authority Ledger/in_game/common/on_action (empty after removing unsupported on_action files)
[SOURCES_USED]
  - Knowledge Base: None
  - Raw: None
[NOTES]
  - Removed unsupported local-control scaling so per-location LA matches the canonical base location formula.
  - Dropped the monthly on_action hook and copied base on_action file to avoid overriding Raw behavior without a defined hook schema.
  - Kept per-location LA storage aligned with the unscaled base location value.
