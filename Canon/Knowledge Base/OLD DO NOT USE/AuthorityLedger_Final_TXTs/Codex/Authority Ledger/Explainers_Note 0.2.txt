Authority Ledger — Explainers Note (MOD CANON)
================================================
[DATE] 2025-12-30
[PURPOSE] Prevent Codex agents from mixing legacy Canon TR thresholds with this MOD's V-system.

BACKGROUND
----------
The Knowledge Base includes legacy canon authority math files (e.g. Explainers/Formulas/TR_Thresholds.txt)
that define a TR (Title Rank) system with large-scale TA thresholds.

THIS MOD OVERRIDE
-----------------
This Authority Ledger MOD uses the V-system (V1–V5) and derives integer T-rank from v4_ta using:

- Codex/Authority Ledger/T_Rank_Thresholds_Draft 0.2.txt

Accordingly:
- Legacy Canon TR thresholds are DEPRECATED for this MOD.
- Do not interpret Canon TR values as this mod's T-rank thresholds.
- When answering as Codex AI for this mod, always prefer the MOD Codex/Authority Ledger files.

NOT DEFINED IN REPO SOURCES
---------------------------
- Whether the engine still computes legacy TR alongside the mod system (unknown).
- Any automatic migration from TR to T-rank (none defined).
