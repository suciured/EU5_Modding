EU5 R-RANK SYSTEM – HANDOFF SUMMARY
Version: Working Design (Authority-Based)
Purpose: Internal documentation for another assistant or developer to continue work consistently.

========================
CORE IDEA
========================

R-rank is an INTERNAL, HIDDEN tier system that represents the degree of political centralization of a state.

- It is NOT shown to the player
- It is NEVER directly set
- It is ALWAYS derived from Authority math

R-rank answers the question:
“How centralized is this state, structurally?”

========================
WHAT R-RANK IS NOT
========================

- Not government rank
- Not legitimacy
- Not absolutism
- Not reforms themselves
- Not a single modifier

R-rank is a meta-state that gates and conditions other systems.

========================
INPUT: NET AUTHORITY
========================

R-rank is derived exclusively from Net Authority (NA).

Definitions recap:
- CA = Central Authority
- LA = Local Authority
- NA = CA − LA

Interpretation:
- Positive NA → Increasing R-Rank
- Negative NA → Decreasing R-Rank

========================
R-RANK TIERS (CONCEPTUAL)
========================

Exact numeric thresholds are INTENTIONALLY UNSET.
They will be tuned later.

Conceptual tiers:

R0-15

========================
HOW R-RANK IS USED
========================

R-rank acts as a CONDITION LAYER, not an effect.

R-rank should rarely modify values directly.
It should gate, unlock, or reshape mechanics.

========================
WHY R-RANK EXISTS
========================

R-rank solves multiple problems:

1. Prevents hardcoding centralization
2. Allows emergent state evolution
3. Makes expansion destabilizing by default
4. Separates economic power from political control
5. Provides a clean backbone for reforms

========================
DESIGN PRINCIPLES
========================

- R-rank is SLOW to change
- R-rank responds to STRUCTURE, not events
- Republics and Monarchies represent the level of centralization 



========================
KEY TAKEAWAYS
========================

- R-rank is derived, never assigned
- Net Authority is the sole input


========================
STATUS
========================

This document reflects the agreed conceptual design.
Thresholds, modifiers, and UI hooks are intentionally deferred.
