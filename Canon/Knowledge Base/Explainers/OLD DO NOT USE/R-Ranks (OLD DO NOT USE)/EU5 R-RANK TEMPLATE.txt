EU5 R-RANK TEMPLATE
Version: Authority-Based System
Status: Baseline
Purpose: Canon-safe reference for continuation and implementation

==================================================
OVERVIEW
==================================================

R-rank is a hidden structural ranking system derived from Net Authority (NA).
It represents how authority is organized within a state.

- R-rank is never shown directly to the player
- R-rank is never manually set
- R-rank is always derived from Net Authority math
- Government type and subject type are orthogonal to R-rank

==================================================
FORMAT NOTES
==================================================

- Only structural identifiers are used (numeric subranks)
- No flavor names are used
- Any undefined data is marked as TBD
- Country-rank distribution is bottom-heavy
- Only two Empire tiers exist (R14–R15)
- Upgrade constraints default to TBD
- Exceptions:
  - R10 → R11 requires Independence
  - R15 is the maximum rank
