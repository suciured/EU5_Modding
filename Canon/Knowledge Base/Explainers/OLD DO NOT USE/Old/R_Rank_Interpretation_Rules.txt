EU5 R-RANK INTERPRETATION RULES
VERSION: 1.0
APPLIES TO: R_Ranks.txt

PURPOSE:
Define how R-ranks are to be interpreted, compared, promoted, and constrained.
This file contains RULES ONLY. No rank data is repeated here.

--------------------------------------------------
CORE DEFINITIONS
--------------------------------------------------

R-RANK:
An abstract measure of administrative, institutional, and political capacity.
R-rank is NOT a title and NOT synonymous with territorial size.

CANON_RANK:
The engine-level rank used by the game system.
Valid values: county, duchy, kingdom, empire.

SUBTYPE:
A flavor classification within an R-rank and government type.
Subtypes do not change canon rank by themselves.

--------------------------------------------------
STRUCTURAL RULES
--------------------------------------------------

RULE 1: ONE CANON RANK PER R
Each R-rank MUST map to exactly one canon rank.
Canon rank never varies within an R.

RULE 2: CANON RANK PROGRESSION
Canon ranks progress strictly in this order:
county -> duchy -> kingdom -> empire
No skips and no barony rank exists.

RULE 3: R IS NOT SIZE
R-rank measures governance capacity, not land area.
A smaller territory may have a higher R than a larger one.

RULE 4: BOTTOM-HEAVY DISTRIBUTION
County R-ranks MUST outnumber empire R-ranks by at least 2:1.
This enforces rarity and fragility of empires.

--------------------------------------------------
PROMOTION RULES
--------------------------------------------------

RULE 5: PROMOTION SCOPE
Most promotions occur within the same canon rank.
Cross-canon promotions are exceptional and explicit.

RULE 6: PROMOTION DIRECTION
Promotions always increase R-rank.
No direct promotion may decrease R.

RULE 7: PROMOTION PATHS
Valid promotions are ONLY those explicitly listed in the rank file.
Unlisted promotions are invalid.

RULE 8: TRADE-BASED EXCEPTIONS
Republic subtypes with strong trade focus may skip a single R tier
when promoting, but never skip a canon rank.

--------------------------------------------------
DEMOTION & COLLAPSE RULES
--------------------------------------------------

RULE 9: DEMOTION EXISTS
Entities may demote one or more R levels due to collapse, reform,
loss of institutions, or overextension.

RULE 10: NO NEGATIVE R
R-rank may never fall below R0.

RULE 11: EMPIRE COLLAPSE PRESSURE
Entities at R14–R15 accumulate structural strain.
Sustained instability MUST trigger:
- fragmentation,
- canon rank downgrade,
- or forced reform.

--------------------------------------------------
HARD CAPS & LIMITS
--------------------------------------------------

RULE 12: HARD CAP
R15 is the absolute maximum.
No entity may exist above R15.

RULE 13: POST-CAP BEHAVIOR
Entities at R15 may not promote further.
Only consolidation, stagnation, or collapse is allowed.

--------------------------------------------------
SUBTYPE RULES
--------------------------------------------------

RULE 14: SUBTYPE FLUIDITY
Subtypes may change without changing R-rank or canon rank,
provided reforms or conditions justify the change.

RULE 15: SUBTYPE ≠ GOVERNMENT CHANGE
Changing subtype does not imply a change in government type
unless explicitly stated by another system.

--------------------------------------------------
INTERACTION RULES
--------------------------------------------------

RULE 16: SUBJECT LOGIC
Higher R entities may hold lower R entities as subjects.
Lower R entities may not hold higher R entities.

RULE 17: MULTI-R EMPIRES
An empire may contain subjects spanning multiple R tiers.
This does not alter the empire’s own R.

--------------------------------------------------
INTERPRETATION SAFETY
--------------------------------------------------

RULE 18: NO INFERENCE
If a relationship, promotion, or mapping is not explicitly defined,
it must be treated as invalid.

RULE 19: CANON FIRST
When conflicts arise, canon rank rules override subtype flavor.

RULE 20: DATA SEPARATION
Interpretation rules must never redefine rank data.
Rank data and rule logic are intentionally separated.
