COMMON/scripted_guis — TEMPLATE (POSSIBILITIES)
======================================
This file lists *observed* key patterns from base data to help modders scaffold files.
Structure-only: it does not define valid values or guarantee all options are accepted.

Where to put your mod file:
- in_game/common/scripted_guis/my_mod_file.txt

Top-level keys seen in this folder (sample / most common):
- <your_key_here>

Common assignment keywords seen in this folder (often-used fields/blocks):
- <field_or_block_here>

Comprehensive example (structure, placeholders only):
# Comprehensive example for COMMON/scripted_guis
# This is a STRUCTURE example using placeholder values.
# Replace placeholders with valid values for this folder.

<your_key_here> = {
    name = <value>
    category = <value>
    value = <value>
    trigger = {
        # ...
    }
    effect = {
        # ...
    }
    modifiers = {
        # ...
    }
}

Minimal skeleton to start:
<key> = {
    # add fields/blocks appropriate for this folder
}
