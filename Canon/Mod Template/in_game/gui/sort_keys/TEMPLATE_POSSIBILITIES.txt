Comprehensive example (structure, placeholders only):
# Comprehensive example for gui/sort_keys
# STRUCTURE ONLY: placeholder values. Replace with valid GUI keys/values.

<gui_block_key> = {
    icon = <value>
    tooltip = <value>
    present_pops = {
        # ...
    }
    their = {
        # ...
    }
    our = {
        # ...
    }
    will = {
        # ...
    }
    price = {
        # ...
    }
    food_income = {
        # ...
    }
    merchant_capacity_profit = {
        # ...
    }
    level = {
        # ...
    }
}

Minimal skeleton to start:
<gui_block_key> = {
    # add properties/blocks appropriate for this directory
}
