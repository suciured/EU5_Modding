EU5 KB - PLUGIN REQUEST GUIDE (STRUCTURE-ONLY)
==============================================

Plugins are organized by BUCKET.
You must request a BUCKET (not a part).

Storage:
- Unzipped: Designer\Plugins\<BUCKET>\
- Zipped:   Designer\PluginZips\<BUCKET>.zip

Request protocol (bucket-only):
  REQUEST_PLUGIN_BUCKET | BUCKET=<bucket>

Examples:
  REQUEST_PLUGIN_BUCKET | BUCKET=MAP
  REQUEST_PLUGIN_BUCKET | BUCKET=LOCALIZATION

How to choose a bucket:
- Use Core\CORE_PLUGIN_BUCKET_INDEX.txt to see which BUCKETs exist.
- Request the most relevant BUCKET; if still missing, request another BUCKET.

Rule:
- Structure-only. Do not infer mechanics.
- If information is missing, request more BUCKETS rather than guessing.
