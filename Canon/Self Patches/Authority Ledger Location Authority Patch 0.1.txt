EU5 Authority Ledger — Location Authority Patch (Semi-Canon)
============================================================
[DATE] 2025-12-31
[SCOPE] Authority Ledger V-system override (location-based)
[STATUS] Semi-Canon (Self Patch)

OVERVIEW
--------
This patch replaces the province-level V2/V3 aggregation with a location-level
model. Authority is generated directly by eligible locations and then summed
into country totals for V4/V5. Provincial capitals no longer matter; only the
country capital location is treated as the central source.

ELIGIBILITY RULES
-----------------
- Central authority uses ONLY the country capital location (is_capital = yes).
- Local authority uses any owned location with:
  - location_rank = location_rank:town OR location_rank:city
  - is_capital = no

LOCATION AUTHORITY VALUE (L1)
-----------------------------
L1(l) = population(l) × development(l)

V-SYSTEM REDEFINITIONS
----------------------
V3.7 — Country Central Base (location-based)
  V3.7 = Σ L1(l) for the single capital location

V3.8 — Country Local Base (location-based)
  V3.8 = Σ L1(l) for all owned town/city locations that are NOT the capital

V4.3 — Net Authority flow (per tick)
  V4.3 = V3.7 + V3.8
  Subject rule remains: if subject, apply 0.5 multiplier to V4.3

V4.4 — Title Authority update (persistent)
  TA(t+1) = TA(t) + V4.3

V5 — T-Rank determination
  Threshold table and independence gate are unchanged from V_System_Spec 0.2

TRACKING LISTS
--------------
- al_local_authority_locations: list of locations contributing to V3.8
  (cleared and rebuilt each tick)

NOTES
-----
- This patch intentionally bypasses province aggregation, control scalars,
  and governance composites. Authority is computed directly per location.
- Use V1 inputs only: population and development at location scope.
