EU5 Authority Ledger — Location Authority Patch (Semi-Canon)
============================================================
[DATE] 2025-12-31
[SCOPE] Authority Ledger V-system override (location-based)
[STATUS] Semi-Canon (Self Patch)

OVERVIEW
--------
This patch replaces the province-level V2/V3 aggregation with a location-level
model. Authority is generated directly by eligible locations and then summed
into country totals for V4/V5. Provincial capitals no longer matter; only the
country capital location is treated as the central source.

ELIGIBILITY RULES
-----------------
- Central authority uses ONLY the country capital location (is_capital = yes).
- Local authority uses any owned location with:
  - location_rank = location_rank:town OR location_rank:city
  - is_capital = no

LOCATION AUTHORITY VALUE (L1)
-----------------------------
L1(l) = population(l) × development(l)

V-SYSTEM REDEFINITIONS
----------------------
V2.5 — Stability scalar
  V2.5 = 0.25 + ( (stability + 100) / 200 × 3.75 )

V2.6 — Government power scalar
  V2.6 = 0.25 + ( government_power / 100 × 3.75 )

V3.2 — Governance composite
  V3.2 = ( V2.5 + V2.6 ) / 2

V3.7 — Country Central Base (location-based)
  V3.7 = Σ ( L1(l) × V3.2 ) for the single capital location

V3.8 — Country Local Base (location-based)
  V3.8 = Σ ( L1(l) × ControlScalar(l) ) for all owned town/city locations that are NOT the capital

ControlScalar(l)
  ControlScalar(l) = 2.0 - ( control(l) / 100 × 1.5 )

V4.3 — Net Authority flow (per tick)
  V4.3 = V3.7 + V3.8
  Subject rule remains: if subject, apply 0.5 multiplier to V4.3

V4.4 — Title Authority update (persistent)
  TA(t+1) = TA(t) + V4.3

V5 — T-Rank determination
  Threshold table and independence gate are unchanged in structure, but the
  values are scaled ×10 for the location-based model:
    T15: TA > 149,999 (independent only)
    T14: TA > 114,999 (independent only)
    T13: TA > 87,999 (independent only)
    T12: TA > 67,999 (independent only)
    T11: TA > 51,999 (independent only)
    T10: TA > 39,999
    T9:  TA > 31,999
    T8:  TA > 24,999
    T7:  TA > 18,999
    T6:  TA > 13,999
    T5:  TA > 9,999
    T4:  TA > 6,999
    T3:  TA > 4,499
    T2:  TA > 2,499
    T1:  TA > 999

TRACKING LISTS
--------------
- al_local_authority_locations: list of locations contributing to V3.8
  (cleared and rebuilt each tick)

NOTES
-----
- This patch intentionally bypasses province aggregation, control scalars,
  and governance composites. Authority is computed directly per location.
- Use V1 inputs only: population and development at location scope.
