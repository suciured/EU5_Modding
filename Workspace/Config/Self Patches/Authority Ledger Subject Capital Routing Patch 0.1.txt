EU5 Authority Ledger — Subject Capital Routing Patch (Self Patch)
============================================================
[DATE] 2025-12-31
[SCOPE] Authority Ledger V-system override (subject routing)
[STATUS] Self Patch

OVERVIEW
--------
Subject capitals contribute to their own Central Base (V3.7), but the same
capital locations also contribute to the overlord's Local Base (V3.8) for
net authority calculations.

RULES
-----
- Subject capital locations are treated as Central Base for the subject.
- Subject capital locations are treated as Local Base for the top overlord.
- Overlord uses the same local control scalar calculation for these capitals.

NOTES
-----
- This patch only alters routing logic; it does not change the V3.7/V3.8
  formulas or T-rank thresholds.
